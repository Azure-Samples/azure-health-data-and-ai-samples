# Inferno Test Applications 

To successfully test ONC (g)(10) with Inferno, you will need to create four separate application registrations to represent the different access scenarios addressed by this test. This method of setting up application registrations is applicable to real SMART on FHIR applications too.

## Patient Standalone Confidential Client / Public Client Applications

The Patient Standalone Launch application is a standard confidential client application which represents an application that can protect a secret (section 1 & 2 of the test). The public client represents an application that cannot protect a secret (section 9 of the test). You will need to follow these instructions twice - once for the confidential client (web) and once for the public client (spa). 

1. Create a new application in Azure Active Directory. Make sure to select platform (Note : You need one application with platform - Web and SPA respectively) and add the redirect URL for Inferno (`https://inferno.healthit.gov/suites/custom/smart/redirect`).
1. In API Permissions for this new application, add the below:
    - Your FHIR Resource API (Delegated)
        - fhirUser
        - launch.patient
        - patient.AllergyIntolerance.read
        - patient.CarePlan.read
        - patient.CareTeam.read
        - patient.Condition.read
        - patient.Device.read
        - patient.DiagnosticReport.read
        - patient.DocumentReference.read
        - patient.Encounter.read
        - patient.Goal.read
        - patient.Immunization.read
        - patient.Location.read
        - patient.MedicationRequest.read
        - patient.Medication.read
        - patient.Observation.read
        - patient.Organization.read
        - patient.Patient.read
        - patient.Practitioner.read
        - patient.PractitionerRole.read
        - patient.Procedure.read
        - patient.Provenance.read
    - Microsoft Graph (Delegated)
        - openid
        - offline_access
1. Generate a secret for this application. Save this and the client id for testing Inferno *1. Standalone Patient App* and *2. Limited Access App*.
1. Follow all instructions on [this page](./set-fhir-user-mapping.md) to enable mapping the `fhirUser` to the identity token.

## EHR Launch Confidential Client Application

The EHR launch confidential client application is a standard confidential client application which represents an application that can protect a secret (section 3 of the test).

1. Create a new application in Azure Active Directory. Make sure to select `Web` as the platform and add the redirect URL for Inferno (`https://inferno.healthit.gov/suites/custom/smart/redirect`).
1. In API Permissions for this new application, add the below:
    - Your FHIR Resource Application (Delegated)
        - fhirUser
        - launch
        - user.AllergyIntolerance.read
        - user.CarePlan.read
        - user.CareTeam.read
        - user.Condition.read
        - user.Device.read
        - user.DiagnosticReport.read
        - user.DocumentReference.read
        - user.Encounter.read
        - user.Goal.read
        - user.Immunization.read
        - user.Location.read
        - user.MedicationRequest.read
        - user.Medication.read
        - user.Observation.read
        - user.Organization.read
        - user.Patient.read
        - user.Practitioner.read
        - user.PractitionerRole.read
        - user.Procedure.read
        - user.Provenance.read
    - Microsoft Graph (Delegated)
        - openid
        - offline_access
1. Generate a secret for this application. Save this and the client id for testing Inferno *3. EHR Practitioner App*.
1. Follow all instructions on [this page](./set-fhir-user-mapping.md) to enable mapping the `fhirUser` to the identity token.

## Backend Service Client Application

Azure Active Directory does not support RSA384 and/or ES384 which is required by the SMART on FHIR implementation guide. In order to provide this capability, custom code is required to validate the JWT assertion and return a bearer token generated for the client with the corresponding client secret in an Azure KeyVault.

1. Create a new application in Azure Active Directory. No platform or redirect URL is needed.
1. Grant this application `FHIR Data Reader` and `FHIR Exporter` role in your FHIR Service.
1. In API Permissions for this new application, add the below:
    - Your FHIR Resource API (Application)
        - system.all.read
1. Grant admin consent for your Application on the API Permission page-->
1. Generate a secret for this application. Save this and the client id.
1. In the resource group that matches your environment, open the KeyVault with the suffix `backkv`.
1. Add a new secret that corresponds to the Application you just generated. 
    - Name: Application ID/Client ID of the application
    - Secret: The secret you generated for the application
    - Tags: Make sure to add the tag `jwks_url` with the backend service JWKS URL. For Inferno testing, this is: https://inferno.healthit.gov/suites/custom/g10_certification/.well-known/jwks.json
1. Save the client id for later testing.
