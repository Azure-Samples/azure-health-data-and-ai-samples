# Azure Health Data Services Samples Repo
The Azure Health Data Services Samples Repo is a set of sample apps and sample code provided to help you get started with Azure Health Data Services, learn how to use our products, and accelerate your implementations. 

This project hosts open-source **samples** for Azure Health Data Services. To learn more about Azure Health Data Services, please refer to the managed service documentation [here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/healthcare-apis-overview)

## Samples

This project provides samples outlining example implementations of various use cases across stages of health data workflows. The "samples" folder contains all the sample apps organized by use case. The samples are listed here:

| [Patient and Population Services (g)(10) (including SMART on FHIR) sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-health-data-services-samples/tree/main/samples/Patient%20and%20Population%20Services%20G10) | Sample utilizing [Azure Health Data Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/fhir/smart-on-fhir) to demonstrate to health organizations with the steps to meet the [§170.315(g)(10) Standardized API for patient and population services criterion](https://www.healthit.gov/test-method/standardized-api-patient-and-population-services#ccg).|

### DICOM service 
|Sample|Description|
| --- | --- |
| [DICOM service demo environment](/samples/dicom-demo-env/) | This sample provisions a full end-to-end demo environment of a simplifed on-prem radiology network in an Azure resource group.  Instructions are provided for configuring and using the DICOM router and ZFP viewer included in the environment. |



NOTE: These code samples are simplified scenarios showing how you can use Azure Health Data Services. These samples should be used for testing purposes only with sample data.
